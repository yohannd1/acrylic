First line

This is a tag: %my_tag

$${ S(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 }

$$: \int_a^b f(x) dx

This is simple inline math: ${ x_2 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n }

inline math 2: $: x^2

This is a backslash: \\

This is *bold text*, and these are \*escaped asterisks\*.
This is _italic text_, and these are \_escaped underscores\_.
This is `inline code`, and these are \`escaped backticks\`.
And this is *_bold-italic_*. And this is _*italic-bold*_ (eh same thing)

This is *bold text with an espaced \* inside it*.

Second line

  Indented sub-line

    Even more indented! %% and this is a comment

    %% This line should also be ignored.

  Inline math in indented-subline: ${ \Delta x }

  And now display math:
  $$: \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \Delta x
  Where ${ \Delta x = \frac {b-a} 2 } and ${ x_i = \Delta x i }

Here are some random stray characters: * $ _ %

( ) This is a task
(x) This is a finished task
(-) This is a cancelled task

This is supposed to be a fold later: %-fold
