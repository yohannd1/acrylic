First line

$${ S(n) = \sum_{i=0}^n i^2 }

$$: \int_a^b f(x) dx

This is simple inline math: ${ x_2 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_n }

inline math 2: $: x^2

This is a backslash: \\

This is *bold text*, and these are \*escaped asterisks\*.
This is _italic text_, and these are \_escaped underscore\_.
This is `inline code`, and these are \`escaped backticks\`.

Second line

  Indented sub-line

    Even more indented!

  Inline math in indented-subline: ${ \Delta x }

  And now display math:
  $$: \int_a^b f(x) dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^n f(x_i) \Delta x, \Delta x = \frac {b-a} 2, x_i = \Delta x i
